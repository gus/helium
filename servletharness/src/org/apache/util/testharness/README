	The purpose of this library is to provide a framework
for feeding canned requests to a servlet and testing the responses.
This makes it possible to write unit tests and regression tests
for servlets, something no other tool I'm aware of supports.

	This code is not for performance testing, and really
doesn't care what environment you use to run your servlet. It makes
calls directly to the Servlet interface; it's a "servlet runner"
focused on testing for correctness.

	The example uses the JUnit testing framework, which
is available at http://members.pingnet.ch/gamma/junit.htm.
