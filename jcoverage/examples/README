EXAMPLES

This directory contains a simple example of using jcoverage to
instrument an application.

To run the example:

ant

The application and its tests will be compiled, jcoverage will
instrument the application, the instrumented application will then be
tested, and a jcoverage report produced in HTML and XML.

The jcoverage reports can be found in:

build/coverage/index.html
build/coverage/coverage.xml
